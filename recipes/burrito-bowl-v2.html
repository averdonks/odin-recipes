    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tofu scrambles up just like <span class="yellow">eggs</span>, and with some clever spices,
        even non-vegans will barely notice the difference. Try setting
        out toppings to let family or guests assemble their own burrito
        bowls.
    </p>

        <li>1 &half; teaspoons cumin</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup chopped fresh <span class="green">cilantro</span></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh <span class="yellow">lemon</span> juice</li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can no-salt-added black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 &half; cups cooked hash brown potatoes</li>
        <li>1 <span class=green>avocado</span> - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
            Add 2 tablespoons oil. Break tofu apart over skillet into
            bite-size pieces, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then cook,
            stirring frequently with a thin metal spatula, until liquid
            cooks out and tofu browns, about 10 minutes.(If you notice
            liquid collecting in pan, increase heat to evaporate water.)
            Be sure to get under the tofu when you stir, scraping the bottom
            of the pan where the good, crispy stuff is and keeping it from
            sticking.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add onion</ and garlic powders, <span class="orange">turmeric</span>, juice, and remaining
            tablespoon oil and toss to coat. Cook 5 minutes more.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Preheat a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add oil.
            Cook onion and <span class="green">jalapenos</span> with a pinch of salt, stirring, until
            translucent, about 5 minutes, Add garlic and cook, stirring, until
            fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add <span class="red">tomatoes</span>, cumin, and remaining salt,
            and cook, stirring, until tomatoes become saucy, about 5 minutes.
            Add <span class="green">cilantro</span> and <span class="yellow">lemon juice</span>. Let <span class="green">cilantro</span> wilt in. Add beans and
            heat through, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Taste for
            salt and seasoning.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Spoon some hash browns into each bowl, followed by a scoop of beans
            and a scoop of <span class="yellow">scramble</span>. Top with <span class="green">avocado</span>, a squeeze of fresh <span class="yellow">lemon
            juice</span>, and a sprinkle of <span class="green">cilantro</span>. Serve with <span class="red">hot sauce</span>.
        </li>
