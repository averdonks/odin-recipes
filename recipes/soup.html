        Healthy potato-leek soup for vegetarians.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>&frac14; cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 leeks, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 &frac34; cups water</li>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>&frac38; teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a stock pot over medium
            heat. Cook and stir leeks in hot oil until completely
            softened, adding remaining olive oil in small amounts
            as you cook the leeks, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour vegetable broth and water into the pot; add potatoes.
            Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and
            cook at a simmer until the potatoes are completely tender,
            about 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour potato mixture into a blender no more than half full.
            Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving
            on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Stir cayenne
            pepper and salt into the soup.
        </li>
    </ol>
